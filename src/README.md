# OutputMLP training for multi speed gait generation
Experiments involve training the OutputMLP taking as input, fourier components obtained by using the integer multiples of fundamental frequency of the output signal. 
## Experiment 1
Training the OutputMLP to reconstruct the control signal for a single speed.
